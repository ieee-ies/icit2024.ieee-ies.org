  							Abstract
  						</h4>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
						The cyber security of critical infrastructures is an essential topic, discipline, and part within national and international security as 16 critical infrastructure sectors touches various aspects of the European and International society.  One focus which has been included is the medical device sector, which should be detailed and focused. Because the failure to provide adequate cybersecurity controls within the critical infrastructure sectors renders the country open to attack that could be a debilitating effect on security, national public health, safety, and economic security, this matter is so vital that there are advances as a national Presidential Policy Directive (PPD).  Critical infrastructure Security and Resilience advances a national policy to strengthen and maintain secure, functioning, and resilient critical infrastructure.  An organization identified as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the mission to be the risk advisor for the United States (US).  Other organizations such as the National Security Agency (NSA), have approved with doctoral-level grading program.  To address this challenge, it is necessary to identify with threats better and defend against them while mitigating risks to an acceptable level.   Only then can a nation build a more secure and resilient infrastructure for the future while defending against present-day bad actors as cyberwarfare, cyber espionage, and cybersecurity attacks are the modern-day threats that need to be addressed in planning, designing, implementation and maintenance.
