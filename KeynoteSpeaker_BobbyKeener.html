  							Abstract
  						</h4>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
The workforce gap for high-demand technology jobs continues to grow. A pre-pandemic IMF report expected a global shortage of more than 85 million tech workers by 2030 which would equate to $8.5 trillion in lost annual revenue. With the post-pandemic acceleration of both current and next generation technologies, this shortage will only continue to grow with McKinsey recently reporting that there are already only sixty-five potential applicants for every one-hundred new technology job openings. In parallel to this growing talent shortage, there are existing talent pools that offer great potential but that are going untapped. These range from veterans, persons with disabilities, and persons already working in related fields, to geographically and demographically underserved communities. This disconnect can be readily illustrated by the fact that even for those persons earning a STEM undergraduate degree in the United States, only twenty-eight percent end up working in a STEM job. What is the disconnect and what are the opportunities to bridge the gap between those persons that have the potential to be successful in these roles, and the employees that need those talent resources. We will discuss this in context to existing talent and employer barriers to success, and how we can overcome them via the use of data and technology to support experiential learning, apprenticeships, talent outreach, and organizational culture alignment.			</p><br>
