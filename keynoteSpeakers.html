						<strong style="text-align: left">Title:</strong> Electric Vehicle Battery Charging Using Plug-in Solutions<br>
						<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Numerous countries have recently set the target for cessation of pure combustion engine car manufacturing within the next 10 to 20 years, leading to substantial acceleration of passenger vehicle electrification. The presentation will at first give an overview of the current EV market, with emphasis on the inverter power rating and dc-link voltage level. This will be followed by a survey of a multitude of different charging options and charging levels for plug-in charging, which will be the topic of the remaining part of the presentation. Wired charging of non-integrated on-board type will be examined first. Topologies of semi-integrated on-board chargers will be reviewed next, including those with integration of either the propulsion motor or the inverter in the charging process. This will be followed by some solutions that provide full integration of on-board chargers and which may become accepted in the future by EV manufacturers. All such fully integrated charger topologies involve multiphase (more than three phases) power electronic converters and machines. </p>

                <strong style="text-align: left">Title:</strong> Dual Control for High Levels of Automation in Uncertain Environments<br>
                <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> For a system operating in an unknown or changing environment, it is desirable to design a control system to keep it always operating at its best possible performance (i. e. in terms of productivity or efficiency). This talk introduces a new approach, namely dual control for exploitation and exploration (DCEE), to this type of self-optimisation control problems. In this framework, the control action not only drives a system moving towards a believed optimal operational condition, but also aims to reduce the uncertainty of this belief by actively exploring and learning the unknown environment. Autonomous search of the source of airborne dispersion using a robot and maximum power point tracking in solar farming are used as case studies to illustrate the proposed DCEE approach. Its link with reinforcement learning and active inference in neuroscience is also discussed.  </p>

                <strong style="text-align: left">Title:</strong> Rolling Friction Model-Based Initial Value Compensation in Fast and Precision Positioning for Industrial Positioning Devices<br>
                <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Fast-response and high-precision motion control is one of indispensable techniques in a wide variety of high performance mechatronic systems including micro and/or nano scale motion, such as data storage devices, machine tools, manufacturing tools for electronics components, and industrial robots, from the standpoints of high productivity, high quality of products, and total cost reduction. In those applications, the required specifications in the motion performance, e.g. response/settling time, trajectory/settling accuracy, etc., should be sufficiently achieved. In addition, the robustness against disturbances and/or uncertainties, the mechanical vibration suppression, and the adaptation capability against variations in mechanisms should be essential properties to be provided in the performance.
                </br>
                  The plenary talk presents the fast and precision motion control techniques, where a 2-degrees-of-freedom (2DOF) control framework is especially handled as one of practical and/or promising approaches to improve the motion performance. Actual issues and relevant solutions for each component in the 2DOF control structure are clarified and, then one of examples, a 2DOF controller design for fast and vibration suppression positioning, is presented as an application to industrial high precision positioning devices. In this speech, especially, a practical approach of mathematical modelling and compensation for friction in the precision positioning is discussing for typical industrial manufacturing machines, e.g. laser processing machine, electronic chip placement machine, semiconductor manufacturing machine, e.tc., where a nonlinear stiff characteristic with hysteresis property of friction in the micro-displacement region can be mathematically modeled using a rheology-based rolling friction model. The friction model can be applied to analyze response variations and slow settling responses in positioning and then, an initial value compensation by mode switching control to ensure the required positioning control specifications.
