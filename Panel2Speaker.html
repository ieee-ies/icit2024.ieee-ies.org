                  <p style="text-align: justify">
                   <strong>Time: Coming soon!</strong> <br>
Modern buildings are becoming more intelligent with advanced optimization, communications, sensors, and control technologies, known as the grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs). GEBs are expected to integrate various flexible resources to achieve net-zero energy consumption for deep decarbonization and provide multi-time-scale ancillary services to the grid, especially under FERC order 2222. Additionally, recent extreme events have also motivated the future buildings to provide resilience when the bulk power systems are undergoing a generation outage or even blackouts. In this panel, the latest progress on controlling and integrating GEBs into the grid will be presented, showcasing the great efforts towards future building-to-grid integration.<br> </p>

  						<strong>Jamie Lian, Group Leader, Grid-interactive Controls group, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)</strong><br>
 				<strong>Brief Biography: </strong>Dr. Lian received the M.S. and Ph.D degrees in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN in 2007 and 2009, respectively. From 2010 to 2011, he worked as a postdoctoral research associate at Center for Advanced Power Systems, Tallahassee, FL, where he was involved in various projects related to the development of future all-electric warship supported by Office of Naval Research (ONR). Prior to joining ORNL, Dr. Lian was a Chief Engineer and Team Lead in Electricity Infrastructure & Building Division at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). He was also the Adjunct Professor at Washington State University Tri-Cities since 2014, where he taught the undergraduate and graduate courses on control.
				Dr. Lianâ€™s research interests focus on the diverse methods from control, optimization, economics, game theory, data analytics and machine learning to improve the reliability and resilience as well as security and sustainability of complex energy systems including power grid and building system. He is specialized in solving the problems with nonclassical challenges imposed by large-scale complex systems. He has served as the project manager, PI/Co-PI and key technical contributor of many large projects focusing on the engagement and integration of various distributed energy resources (DERs) into the future distribution management system. In particular, he has established the theoretical foundation of market-based control (aka. transactive control) for future transactive energy system. He has authored or co-authored 3 book chapters and over 80 technical publications in peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and delivered more than 15 invited talks. He also hold 8 U.S. patent applications (5 granted) and 3 Canadian patent applications.
