                  <p style="text-align: justify">
                   <strong>Time: Coming soon!</strong> <br>
This panel will focus on Cybersecurity of industry applications, with emphasis on Industry 4.0, powered by the 5G’s capability of machine type communication (mMTC). While 5G will fuel the explosive growth of wirelessly connected internet of things (IoT), these devices will also introduce vulnerabilities that can be used to not only initiate attacks on the devices but initiate attacks from the devices on the 5G network. The panel will discuss and answer questions on the security of 5G connected cyber physical devices and related topics.<br> </p>
